# ShapeScape VR

ShapeScape is an immersive educational VR puzzle game that makes learning math visual, interactive, and fun. Designed especially for students, ShapeScape helps players build a strong understanding of geometry, spatial reasoning, and formulas — all within an engaging virtual environment.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

Players are placed in a 3D classroom where they must:

- Match unfolded 2D nets (UVs) to their correct 3D shapes
- Interact with objects using VR hand controls
- Solve visual-spatial puzzles under a global 5-minute timer
- Use logic and memory to complete formula-based challenges in later levels

Correctly placed shapes animate and glow, while incorrectly placed ones return to their original positions. Each decision matters — and time is always ticking.

## 🧠 Educational Goals

ShapeScape is ideal for:
- Middle and high school students
- Classrooms that use interactive or VR-based learning
- Anyone interested in learning geometry through intuitive exploration

## 🕹️ VR Controls

| Action               | Control                         |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Move forward         | Left-hand thumbstick             |
| Move backward        | Right-hand thumbstick            |
| Grab & Place Shapes  | VR hand interaction              |

## 🕒 Time Mechanics

The game runs on a total 5-minute timer. Players must complete all shape-matching puzzles within this duration. Each shape batch (typically 3 shapes at a time) must be solved before new ones appear. If the time runs out, the game ends.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Real 3D geometry with accurate 2D nets  
- ✅ Timed puzzle batches with instant feedback  
- ✅ Auto-correction for incorrect placements  
- ✅ VR-compatible with intuitive hand controls  
- ✅ Clean classroom aesthetic and stylized environment  
- ✅ Supports expansion with math formulas and logic puzzles
